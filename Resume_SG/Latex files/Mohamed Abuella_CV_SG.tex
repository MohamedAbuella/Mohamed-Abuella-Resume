%I am Mohamed Abuella, who received a M.Sc degree in Electrical and Computer
%Engineering from Southern Illinois University Carbondale in 2012, and a Ph.D degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte on December 15th, 2018.
%
%My research interest is on planning and operations of electrical power systems. I have worked on optimization applications for electric power systems during my M.Sc thesis, specifically on economic dispatch and optimal power flow for systems that including wind energy.
%
%In my Ph.D program, among of my first courses was the Energy Markets and Energy Analytics courses, which were brand new courses and taught by top faculty members at Electrical Engineering, Economic, and Engineering Management departments. Since then, I have been working with a research group whose main scope is on renewable energy resources grid integration. My role is on statistical and predictive analytics to mitigate the variability issues that imposed by these intermittent resources for optimizing grid integration. We are developing an approach to leverage the situational awareness tools to integrate these renewable resources efficiently with the electric power systems.
%
%I hope to offer me a job to get the opportunity to work with the experts of this field.
%
%If you need further information, just let me know.
%
%I am looking forward to hearing from you.
%
%Thanks for your cooperation and attention.
