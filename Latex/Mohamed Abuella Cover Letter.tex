I am Mohamed Abuella, who received a B.Tech from College of Industrial Technology, Misurata, Libya, and M.Sc degree in Electrical and Computer
Engineering from Southern Illinois University Carbondale in 2012, and a Ph.D degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in 2018.

%my Ph.D program, I have been working with a research group whose main scope is on renewable energy resources grid integration. My role is on data-driven analytics to mitigate the variability issues that imposed by these intermittent resources for optimizing grid integration.

%I am interested on modernizing the power grid and optimizing its integration of renewables by applying optimization and data-driven techniques.

%My research interests are mainly on applying machine learning and data-driven analytics for smart grid applications.

%My research interests include planning and operations of electrical power systems.
%During my M.Sc thesis I have worked on optimization applications for electric power systems, specifically on economic dispatch and optimal power flow for systems that including wind energy resources.\\
%
%After that, in my Ph.D program, I have been working with a research group whose main scope is on renewable energy resources grid integration. My role is on statistical and predictive analytics to mitigate the variability issues that imposed by these intermittent resources for optimizing grid integration. We are developing an approach to leverage the situational awareness tools to integrate these renewable resources efficiently with the electric power systems.

%I would like to apply for the available position as a Electrical Power Systems Researcher at CSIRO.

I like working in a diverse environment for an interdisciplinary research. My research interests on the application of machine learning and optimization techniques.\\


Since the starting of my Ph.D study, in 2014, I have been involved extensively with data-driven analytics for several applications, such analytics for energy, trading \& risk, and shipping.

I would like to apply for the opening position, and hope to get the opportunity to collaborate and work with the experts of this field.

%I came across your job posting. So, I would like to apply for it.


%Please refer to my CV, transcripts, list of references, and a one-page personal statement of research \& interests.
